## About
This package was made in preparation for the clas INFO 550. It stores a data rda object named "trachoma_data", several functions that clean data and make figures, as well as a vignette. The tidyverse and rmarkdown packages were used to build this package. 

## Install
To install the package, please run the following code. This code was specifically tailored to download the vignette as well because this doesn not happen by default. 
**devtools::install_github("pahongle/tfreport", build_vignettes = TRUE)**

## Vignette
To see the vignette with the associated report, please run the following code after installing the package.
**vignette("trachoma_report", package="tfreport")**
