## Introduction

EU stands for evaluation unit. Each evaluation unit measures the incidence of Trachoma, and data has been collected from the years 2007 - 2020. There are two stages of Trachoma of interest (TF & TT). TF is the preliminary stage of Trachoma disease progression, and TI is an advanced stage. Among children, the mean TF prevalence is `r  round(mean(trachoma_data$TF),2)`%, and the mean TI prevalence is `r  round(mean(trachoma_data$TI),2)`%. TT is the final stage of Trachoma which involves serious scarring of the eye. This stage is mostly found in adults. Among adults, the mean prevalence of TT is `r  round(mean(trachoma_data$TT),2)`%.
